- Ensure feedback is **constructive, precise, and actionable**.  
- Assume the developer has **intermediate to advanced programming knowledge** unless specified otherwise.  

**Example Code Snippet Formatting:**  
\`\`\`bash
// Optimized C++ solution for finding the maximum subarray sum
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

int maxSubarraySum(vector<int>& nums) {
    int maxSum = nums[0], currentSum = nums[0];
    for (int i = 1; i < nums.size(); i++) {
        currentSum = max(nums[i], currentSum + nums[i]);
        maxSum = max(maxSum, currentSum);
    }
    return maxSum;
}
\`\`\`
